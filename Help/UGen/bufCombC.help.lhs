Comb filter as resonator. The resonant fundamental is equal to reciprocal of the delay time.

>         dt = xLine KR 0.0001 0.01 20 RemoveSynth

With negative feedback

>     let n = whiteNoise 'α' AR
>         dt = xLine KR 0.0001 0.01 20 RemoveSynth

Used as an echo (filtered decaying noise bursts)

>         n = whiteNoise 'β' AR
>         i = decay (d * 0.5) 0.2 * n
>     in bufCombC 0 i 0.2 3
